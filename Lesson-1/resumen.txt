x = 5 + 3

When we write this line in Python, many things happen beneath the surface.

High-level code (Python):
The programmer writes an easy-to-read instruction like x = 5 + 3.

Interpreter:
Python’s interpreter translates this line into bytecode, a low-level set of instructions that the computer can understand.

CPU and instructions:
The CPU executes these instructions step by step.

It loads the numbers 5 and 3 into its internal registers.

It performs the addition using the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).

It stores the result (8) in memory under the variable x.

Memory:
The memory (RAM) temporarily holds the data (5, 3, and 8) and the program instructions while the CPU processes them.

Instruction cycle (Fetch–Decode–Execute):
For each instruction, the CPU:

Fetches the next instruction from memory.

Decodes it (understands what to do).

Executes it (performs the operation).
This happens millions of times per second.

High-level vs. Low-level view:

High-level: x = 5 + 3 (what we see).

Low-level:

LOAD R1, 5  
LOAD R2, 3  
ADD R3, R1, R2  
STORE R3, x


The low-level instructions are what the CPU actually executes.

Summary:

A simple Python line like x = 5 + 3 goes through several layers — from Python code, through the interpreter, into CPU instructions — and finally produces a result stored in memory.
The CPU continuously repeats the fetch–decode–execute cycle to make programs run
